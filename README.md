# ADAMS

1. Task: Given text from the online publishing platform Medium, create a ML-model to predict the number of claps a post is going to receive based on its content

2. ML-Models used: cuDNNLSTM (cuDNN stands for Nvidia Cuda Deep Neural Network), Linear Ridge Regression as a Benchmark
- cuDNN: an acceleration libray for neural networks by Nvidia; due to GPU use, the library speeds up the fitting significantly

3. Hyperparameter Optimization: Tree Parzen Estimator  

4. Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, optuna, scikit-learn, gensim, BeautifulSoup
